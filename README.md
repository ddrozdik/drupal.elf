**External Links Filter**

External Links Filter (ELF) is an input filter that adds small icons to external and mailto links, 
informing users the link will take them to a new site or open their email client. 
It also includes the ability of adding "rel=nofollow" to links as well. 
Wikipedia is a well-known example of this technique.
